# Advent Of Code solutions

Hello in my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

This is not a reference solutions, or anything like that.
The code here is not meant to be pretty, particularly performant or in any way special.

I just like programming puzzles, and learning, so I often combine both.
### 2021 - Time to learn Haskell

[haoc2021](haoc2021)

I had few attempts over the years, but finally the time seemed suiting.
Or I just felt need for some challenge.

Anyway, somehow dubbing into my first AoC I decided to also learn Haskell.
It's pretty cool tbh. And as far, it wasn't that hard after all ;)
