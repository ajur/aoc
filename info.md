# Advent Of Code solutions

Hello in my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles.

This is not a reference solutions, or anything like that.
The code here is not meant to be pretty, particularly performant or in any way special
(heck, sometimes its stright up bad codding practices you should not use in production ;P ).

I just like programming puzzles, and learning, so I often combine both.

### 2024 - Back to TS, with Deno2

This time trying to build some proper lib for faster solving aoc...
or at least for having more fun with it, and learning some more typing tricks along the way :D

In the same time, taking adventage of [Deno 2](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0), 
its support for [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/jupyter/),
but running it not through actual jupyter nb, but through [Zed REPL](https://zed.dev/docs/repl).

Also, as a prep for this year, I've also did some of AOC 2016, and some reorganization of the repo, more lang-centric than year centric.

### 2023 - Going easy on myself with ugly JS :P

Ok, maybe not that ugly - there are still some concepts I took out of doing aoc in Haskell.
JS is pretty versitile in that, and you can go pretty wild with FP if you really want to...
altough I still miss some features of pure FP lang.

### 2022 - Getting used to TypeScript...

... well, kinda. I started to do AoC but stoped somewhat in half way.
Had to pack my stuff as I was moving :)

### 2021 - Time to learn Haskell

I had few attempts over the years, but finally the time seemed suiting.
Or I just felt need for an extra challenge while starting with AdventOfCode.

Anyway, somehow dubbing into my first AoC I decided to also learn Haskell.
It's pretty cool tbh. And as far, it wasn't that hard after all ;)

ps. to actually do first few days of AoC in time, [I've done them in JS](https://observablehq.com/@ajur/advent-of-code-2021),
using fantastic [ObservableHQ notebooks](https://observablehq.com/).
