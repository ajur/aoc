## TypeScript with Deno 2

To just run a solution, enter proper year dir, e.g. `cd 2024` and run with deno `deno day01.ts`, or `deno day01.ts -v` for some extra logs. Thats it...

... or is it?

Actually, in source there sometimes lots of code not used in such run, as when working on this solutions,
I've used Zed editor with it REPL mode, working a bit like Jupyter notebooks.

If you run the code in this way, than you'll be able to see some debugging intermediate steps,
and maybe even some images :).
